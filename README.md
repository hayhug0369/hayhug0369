- 👋 Hi, I’m @hayhug0369
- 👀 I’m interested in building an app that can integrate with smart glasses that has conversations with me, generates diverse content based on user input, can perform tasks such as text summarization, voice cloning, can handle complex and creaitve requests such as writing stories, composing music. Can take a photo and describe to me what it recognizes in the photo, can turn text in a photo to speech.
